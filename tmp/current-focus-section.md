### Current Focus (Phase 1 Tasks)
- Completed: bootstrap `LanguageProvider`, `createWorkspaceScanner`, and `JsLanguageProvider` scaffolding.
- Completed: bridged `dev/js-scan` scanner to `createWorkspaceScanner` while preserving the public API surface.
- Completed: catalogued CLI printing, IO, and hash helpers in `js-scan.js` / `js-edit.js` using targeted `js-scan` searches.
- Completed: introduced shared `tsnjs/core/cliEnvironment` helpers and adopted them in `js-edit.js` + `js-scan.js`.
- Completed: centralized CLI option normalization in `tsnjs/core/cliOptions` and aligned `js-scan.js` with the shared helpers.
- Completed: extracted shared `tsnjs/core/cliReporting` helpers for dependency summaries, parse errors, and ripple output; reran `npx jest --config jest.config.cjs --runTestsByPath src/tools/__tests__/js-scan.test.js --bail=1 --maxWorkers=50%` to confirm behaviour.
- Completed: delivered TypeScript scaffolding (`TsLanguageProvider`, TypeScript scanner/file contexts, env-selectable CLI bridges, `ts-edit.js`, `ts-scan.js`) plus fixtures and Jest coverage (`ts-scan.test.js`).
- Baseline: js-edit and js-scan Jest suites pass; monitor the lingering worker teardown warning reported by the js-edit tests.
- Completed: Filtered out type-only imports from runtime dependency reporting in the TypeScript file record and extended fixtures/tests to lock the behaviour down.
- Paused: Continue migrating search/reporting helpers (`printSearchTerse`, `printSearchResult`, `printHashLookup`, `printPatternResult`, `printChineseHelp`, `printHelpOutput`) into `tsnjs/core/cliReporting`, keeping `src/tools/dev/js-scan.js` in lockstep.
- Next: Document TypeScript CLI usage and extend recipe dispatchers to surface TS commands alongside the JS variants.
- Upcoming: Resume shared reporter extraction once the TS bridge stabilises and broaden regression coverage for mixed JS/TS scenarios.
